# Ecommerce Customer Churn Prediction

## Introduction
**This README.md file outlines the customer churn prediction approach employed by Retailkart.com, a small and medium-scale organization specializing in wine, fruit, and meat products. The objective is to identify customers who are likely to churn, i.e., stop using the platform, within a specified time window of 3 months. Predicting customer churn can help Retailkart.com take proactive measures to retain valuable customers and reduce churn rates.**

## Problem Statement
The problem at hand is to build a customer churn prediction model that can identify customers at risk of churning within the 3-month time window. The model will be trained on historical customer data, including transaction history, online behavior, and demographics. The goal is to predict whether a customer will churn or continue using the platform in the near future.

## Data Collection and Preparation
Retailkart.com will collect historical customer data, including transaction history, online behavior, and demographics. This data will be cleaned, processed, and organized for model training. The target variable will be created based on the time window of 3 months, identifying churned-out customers


## Model Training and Evaluation
To predict customer churn, Retailkart.com will use machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting. The dataset will be split into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

The evaluation metrics for the churn prediction model include accuracy, precision, and recall. Retailkart.com will select the best-performing model based on these metrics and fine-tune the model's hyperparameters as needed.

## Implementation and Deployment
Once the churn prediction model is developed and evaluated, Retailkart.com will deploy the model in its operational environment. The model will be integrated into the customer relationship management (CRM) system to identify at-risk customers in real-time.

## Customer Retention Strategies
Based on the predictions from the churn model, Retailkart.com will implement targeted customer retention strategies, including personalized offers, reactivation campaigns, excellent customer support, loyalty programs, and email campaigns. These strategies aim to incentivize repeat purchases, re-engage churned customers, encourage customer loyalty, and provide a better shopping experience.

## Conclusion
By leveraging customer churn prediction and implementing targeted customer retention strategies, Retailkart.com aims to reduce churn rates, retain valuable customers, and drive business growth. The predictive model and personalized approach will enable Retailkart.com to stay competitive in the online retail market and provide a better shopping experience to its customers.
